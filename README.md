# Klaviyo-s-Data-Scrapping
This project involves creating a matrix that represents Klaviyo's Email and SMS pricing in USD, based on their pricing structure as described on their website. The matrix should be organized as follows:

- The columns represent the different "monthly SMS/MMS credits" options provided by Klaviyo.
- The rows represent the different "how many contacts do you have" options.
- Each cell in the matrix contains the corresponding USD price of the Email and SMS plan for the combination of monthly SMS/MMS credits and the number of contacts.

The goal is to automate the process of scraping this pricing information from the Klaviyo website and generate a CSV or Excel file containing the matrix. Manual extraction of this data would be time-consuming due to the large number of rows and columns involved (51 rows and 43 columns).

To accomplish this project, one would need to:

1. Use web scraping techniques to extract the pricing information from the Klaviyo pricing page, specifically focusing on the Email and SMS pricing details.
2. Organize the extracted data into the desired matrix format, mapping monthly SMS/MMS credits to columns and the number of contacts to rows.
3. Convert the matrix data into a CSV or Excel file format as requested.
This project requires proficiency in web scraping techniques, data manipulation, and file handling in Python or another suitable programming language. Additionally, attention to detail is crucial to ensure accurate extraction and organization of the pricing information.
By automating the data collection and processing steps, I significantly reduced the time and effort required to generate the pricing matrix. What could have been a time-consuming manual task was completed efficiently through automation.
The resulting CSV file contained a comprehensive pricing matrix covering all relevant combinations of monthly SMS/MMS credits and contact tiers. The matrix accurately represented Klaviyo's pricing structure, providing valuable insights for decision-making.
